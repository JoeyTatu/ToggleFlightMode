# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 18 December 2024

Toggle Flight Mode ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.

## Information We Do Not Collect
We value your privacy and are pleased to inform you that Toggle Flight Mode does not collect, store, or share any of your personal or non-personal data.

## Permissions Used

### Managing Phone Calls
To provide the core functionality of our app, Toggle Flight Mode requires access to your phone calls. This permission is used solely to detect when a call has ended.  

- **Why we use this permission:** The app utilises this permission to perform actions triggered by the end of a call, to then show a notification to the user.  
- **What we do with this permission:** No call data, personal information, or metadata (e.g., phone numbers, call duration) is collected, stored, or shared.  

### Exclusion from Battery Optimisation
This permission is used to allow Toggle Flight Mode to be active in the background, so that a user's device does not stop the app. This ensures Toggle Flight Mode can show a notification when a call ends.

### Notifications
This is a core feature of the app. Notifications are required to show a notification as a reminder to toggle flight mode off and on after each call.

## No Internet Access
Our app operates without requiring internet access, ensuring that your usage of the app remains completely offline.

## No Third-Party Services
Toggle Flight Mode does not have direct third-party access to your data. However, as required by Google Play Store's terms and conditions, limited data analysis may be collected and sent to Google to ensure app functionality, security, and compliance with their policies.

- **What this means for you:** This data handling is managed solely by Google and adheres to their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not store or have access to any of this data.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Since no data is collected, our app is safe for use by individuals of all ages, including children under 13.

## Your Consent
By using Toggle Flight Mode, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary. Any changes will be reflected here, with the updated effective date.
